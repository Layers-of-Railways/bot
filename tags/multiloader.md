Steam 'n' Rails is developed in a Multi-loader environment
That means updates are worked on and released for both fabric and forge simultaneously.
If an update takes a while to release, it's likely waiting for create fabric to update.
Please be patient and keep in mind that create fabric is a separate team that has to wait for many dependencies.
